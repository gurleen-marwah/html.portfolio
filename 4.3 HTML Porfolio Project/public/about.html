<p>Millions of people have walked the earth and many will still do. However, no two people have the same characteristics even among identical twins. Personalities, regardless of how dissimilar, make the world full of varieties. This is why I know I am uniquely me and the best version of myself there is.

I believe people should strive to improve their life and be the best they can ever be regardless of how impossible the task may be.</p>
